# Proteles — Claude working notes

Proteles is a native macOS (later iPad) MUD client focused exclusively on
**Aardwolf**. Swift 6, strict concurrency. The living design doc is
**PLAN.md** (read it first); decisions are logged there as D-NN.

## Reference submodules — ALWAYS research them

The repo vendors three reference MUD clients as git submodules. They are
**reference-only — never modify them**:

- `mushclient/` — Nick Gammon's MUSHclient (C++, Windows). The Aardwolf
  community's historical client.
- `mudlet/` — Mudlet (C++/Qt + Lua, cross-platform).
- `aardwolfclientpackage/` — the Lua plugin package for MUSHclient,
  Aardwolf-specific (channels, GMCP, soundpack, mapper, etc.).
- `iterm2/` — terminal reference (ANSI/rendering only).

**Standing instruction:** When researching, designing, implementing, or
fixing any Aardwolf- or MUD-specific feature, ALWAYS investigate how these
submodules handle it first. They encode years of real-world protocol
quirks and UX decisions. You have **standing approval to read and search
submodule code at any time without asking** — just do it as part of the
work.

Useful anchors found so far:
- Aardwolf communication/channel command list (for autocomplete
  exclusions, chat capture, etc.):
  `aardwolfclientpackage/MUSHclient/worlds/plugins/aard_channels_fiendish.xml`
  and `aard_chat_echo.xml`.
- Command history + tab-completion: Mudlet `src/TCommandLine.cpp`;
  MUSHclient `sendvw.cpp`.
- Auto-login ("Diku-style"): MUSHclient `doc.cpp` (`ConnectionEstablished`);
  Mudlet `src/ctelnet.cpp`.

## Architecture (SwiftPM)

One `Package.swift`. Libraries:
- **MudCore** — platform-agnostic core (networking, telnet, ANSI, MCCP2,
  pipeline, session, profiles, scrollback, persistence, replay). No UI.
- **MudUI** — SwiftUI views (cross-platform; macOS-specific bits guarded
  with `#if os(macOS)`). Depends on MudCore.
- **MudOutputView_macOS** — AppKit/TextKit 2 output view. Depends on
  MudCore.

The macOS app target lives in `apps/ProtelesApp_macOS/` and is generated
with XcodeGen (`project.yml`). Regenerate with `xcodegen generate` from
that directory after changing sources/resources.

### Local code signing (one-time)

The app is signed with a stable, self-signed dev identity named
**`Proteles Dev`**. Run once on a new machine:

```bash
./scripts/create-dev-signing-cert.sh
```

Without it, `xcodebuild` falls back to ad-hoc signing, which has no stable
code identity — so macOS re-prompts for Keychain access on every build even
after "Always Allow". The stable identity gives the app a constant
*designated requirement* so the grant persists. Releases will use a real
Developer ID instead. (CI only runs `swift build`/`swift test`, so it never
needs the cert.)

## Definition of done — the four gates

Before committing, ALL must pass (run from repo root):

1. `swift build`
2. `swift test --parallel`
3. `swiftformat --lint .`
4. `swiftlint --strict`

swiftformat/swiftlint occasionally disagree (e.g. `for ... where` brace
placement) — rewrite the code so both pass rather than disabling rules.

Do **not** build the app into the repo tree (e.g. `build/DerivedData`);
swiftformat/swiftlint will then scan the build output. Build test apps to a
path outside the repo, e.g.
`-derivedDataPath /tmp/proteles-build/DerivedData`.

## Workflow conventions

- Work in phases per PLAN.md; keep high test coverage; new logic gets
  thorough tests (prefer pure, value-type models in MudCore so they're
  unit-testable without the UI/network).
- Split work into logical commits with detailed messages explaining the
  *why*. Co-author trailer:
  `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>`
- After a feature lands, produce a Release build for the user to verify
  interactively, then push to GitHub.
- TLS is deferred to post-1.0 (D-15, issue #3); the client is plain telnet
  for now.
